# CNN_CAPTCHA_Solver
This is a project for ECCS4621.01 Deep Learning CAPTCHA Solver with CNNs Assignment. I have used a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) model to break the CAPTCHAs found in the dataset from Wilhelmy, Rodrigo & Rosas, Horacio. (2013) obtained through [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fournierp/captcha-version-2-images?resource=download). The CAPTCHAs in this dataset are all 200 x 50 grayscale images that consist of 5 characters(letters and numbers) with a blur and a line striking through them. This model outputs an accuracy of 75-85 depending on the way you run it. Google Colab generally gives lower estimates, while Python options installed on a computer(like Spyder) will provide a higher estimate. 

# Required Libraries
This program mainly utilizes Tensorflow and Keras to create the CNN model. The dataset was prepared using os, numpy, cv2, and sklearn test_train_split libraries. Lastly matplotlib is used to evaluate the model at the end.

# Loading Dataset
waiting after I try to streamline the process a little better
